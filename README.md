# **Pentagram: Realtime Image Diffusion**

> Pentagram is a web app that enables users to generate images from text prompts using a self-hosted image generation model, like Stable Diffusion, on serverless GPUs. It offers an Instagram-like experience, where users can create, like, comment, and share images, all while ensuring low-latency performance for a smooth interaction.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will build a web app where users can generate images using text prompts via an image generation model that you host on serverless GPUs.

### **Technologies Used:**

- **React** 
- **TypeScript**
- **Modal**
- **APIs**
- **Authentication**
- **Hardware Infrastructure**

### **Project Concept:**

Instead of users uploading their own pictures, they can generate images with text prompts. You'll host an image generation model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) yourself on serverless GPUs, ensuring low-latency performance for a smooth user experience. This app will have an Instagram-like interface, where users can interact socially through likes, comments, and sharing features.

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

First, clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/team-headstart/pentagram.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd pentagram
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## **Tasks**

### **Important Files to Review**

- **`src/app/page.tsx`:**  
  This is where the user can input their prompt and generate an image. Ensure that you update the UI and handle the API response to display the generated images.

- **`src/app/api/generate-image/route.ts`:**  
  This is where the image generation API is implemented. Make sure to call your image generation API hosted on Modal here.

## **Project Requirements**

- **Host an Image Generation Model on Serverless GPUs:**  
  Host a model like Stable Diffusion on Modal, ensuring low-latency performance for a smooth user experience.
  
- **Web App Features:**  
  Create a web app that allows users to generate images from text prompts, manage their creations, and interact socially with features like likes, comments, and sharing.

- **UI/UX and Image Management:**  
  Build an intuitive UI/UX with proper authentication and efficient image management. Include a prompt history to enhance the user experience.
